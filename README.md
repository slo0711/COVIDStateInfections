A look into how a US state's political affiliation affects it's overall infection rate per capita

**Research question: Does the party affiliation of the state legislature affect the Covid-19 infection rate of a state?**

## Introduction
Beginning around 2019, the world faced a pandemic, from the coronavirus (Covid-19), that would claim the lives of millions of people. For many, this was the first time experiencing such a devastating event. This virus was highly infectious and spread at rapid rates. Governments were then looked upon to figure out how to control the spread, to save as many lives as possible. In the United States, this came in the form of both Federal and State level mandates, like the implementation of shelter in place, business closures, and mask requirements. However, people had many different opinions on the best way of controlling Covid-19, especially between political parties, leading to states implementing different guidelines at various times. In the United States, two political parties, the Democratic Party and the Republican party, usually control state governments. The party in control of a particular state's legislature dictated the guidelines to enact. In this study, we analyzed whether a state's controlling party had any impact on the spread of the virus, by looking at the state's number of infections per capita. By being able to draw conclusions on these effects, we can better prepare ourselves against future pandemics and potentially save lives.
